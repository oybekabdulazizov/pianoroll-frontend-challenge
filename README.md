# PianoRoll Frontend Task


## Description

**Part 1: Display** has been fully implemented. Its design is just like YouTube. 

**Part 2: Interactive Selection Tool** was rather an interesting and challenging part. No matter what I tried, I was unable to get the highlight displayed in the UI. I guess I will have to work more on SVGs ðŸ˜…. 


## Code and Demo 

You can just see the published demo [here](https://pianoroll-frontend-challenge.vercel.app/). 

Please copy this repository url and clone it into your local machine (I am assuming that you already have GIT installed). 

Once cloned the repo, enter the below commands into your terminal/powershell one by one: 

```
cd pianoroll-frontend-challenge 
npm i 
npm run dev
```

Then, open localhost:3000 in your browser, check the demo, and go through the code as you wish.
