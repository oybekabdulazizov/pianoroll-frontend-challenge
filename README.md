# PianoRoll Frontend Task


## Description

**Part 1: Display** has been fully implemented. It's design is just like YouTube. 

**Part 2: Interactive Selection Tool** was rather an interesting and challenging part. No matter what I tried, I was unable to get the highlight displayed in the UI. I guess I will have to work more on SVGs ðŸ˜…. 


## Code and Demo 

Please copy this repository url and clone it into your local machine (I am assuming that you already have GIT installed on your machine). 

Once cloned the repo, enter the below commands into your terminal/powershell one by one: 

```
cd pianoroll-frontend-challenge 
npm i 
npm run dev
```

Then, open localhost:3000 in your browser and see the demo and go through the code as you wish. 

Alternatively, you can just go to this link and it will have [the published demo](https://pianoroll-frontend-challenge.vercel.app/).
